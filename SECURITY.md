# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please report any security issue you're aware of concerning the last version of the plugin.

A patch will be shortly created as a newer version.

Only the last version is concerned, as only the last version is at all time available in the Mozilla Extensions store.
It is expected that the (numerous) users of this extension keep it up-to-date on their machine.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please go to this repository's [Security Advisories tab](https://github.com/MaelImhof/courseware-enhancer/security/advisories).

Your report should be read and get an answer in two days, if not feel free to follow up.

If your report is accepted as a vulnerability, and depending on my sufficient/insufficient knowledge of the issue and available time at the moment,
I'll either create a patch directly or make some researches, maybe asking for some help if you have the time and the knowledge to help me.
